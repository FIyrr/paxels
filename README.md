## Introduction

This Datapack adds **Paxels**, a combination of **P**ickaxe, **Axe** and Shov**el**, which can efficiently mine all blocks which can be mined by Pickaxes, Axes and Shovels and can also be used to strip logs and create paths just like you can use axes and shovels!

They can be enchanted with every Pickaxe/Shovel/Axe enchantment but only if you hold them in your mainhand when right clicking the anvil to open its GUI! (This happens due to technical limitations of datapacks and can't be changed)

## Crafting
You can craft them by simply putting a Pickaxe, Axe and Shovel of the desired material in the crafting grid of either your inventory or a crafting table. Note that this will show a knowledge book as output but still give the item you were originally crafting when clicked!

To upgrade a Diamond Paxel to Netherite just combine it with a Netherite Ingot in a Smithing Table

## Required Recourcepack
While the datapack doesn't exactly "require" the Recourcepack to work, it's highly reccomended to use it to see the paxel's custom texture!

## Incompatibility
+ Mods/Datapacks that unlock all recepies
